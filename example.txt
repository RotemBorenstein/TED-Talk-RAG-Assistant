- The birth of the open-source learning revolution
- Do schools kill creativity?
- One Laptop per Child

Explanation (from the provided TED data):
- "The birth of the open-source learning revolution" (Richard Baraniuk) is explicitly about text
books, educational materials and creating a "knowledge ecosystem" for learning â e.g., the trans
cript describes imagining "take all the world's books... digitizing them... make it all open... put people into this" and mentions the Connexions project (Chunk 5).
- "Do schools kill creativity?" (Sir Ken Robinson) directly addresses the purpose and structure 
of public education, arguing we must "rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children" and to "educate their whole being" (Chunks 3 and 6).
- "One Laptop per Child" (Nicholas Negroponte) focuses on education and learning technology â th
e talk is framed around why education matters and how laptops/computers change learning to be "driven by the learner himself or herself" (Chunk 4).
